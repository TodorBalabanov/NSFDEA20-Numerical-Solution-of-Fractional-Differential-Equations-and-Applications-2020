\underline{Introduction} \\

In the field of distributed computing there is a special branch in which human brain capabilities are involved in order complex task to be solved. Generally distributed computing is used in complex task where desktop computers and even supercomputers are not able to calculate the results in acceptable amount of time or in acceptable calculations price. In order particular problem to fit in distributed computing system such problem should fit in the class of parallel algorithms. It means that different steps in the calculations should have certain degree of independence as instructions flow. The main differences between parallel computing and distributed computing is that distributed systems are heterogeneous with network latency, without central clock and in most cases calculating nodes are not under our own control. \\

Distributed computing becomes invaluable when calculated problems are outside of the capabilities available in the modern computers. The brightest example for such situation is when subjective human opinion is needed for evolution of beauty. One of the most famous human-distributed computing projects is the Electric Sheep Screensaver (Scott Draves 1999). In this project artificial animals are generated in the form of fractal animations. These artificial individuals are evolved with genetic algorithms. The key point in this project is that the fitness value for genetic algorithm individuals is calculated by users voting. If the user likes the animated he/she votes with thumb-up. If the user dislike the animation he/she votes with thumb-down. The vote of the users is collected on the server side and it is used for the genetic algorithms evolution process. Subjective opinion for beauty of many different people is the key element in creation of such computer generated art.
